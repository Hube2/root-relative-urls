root-relative-urls
==================

This is a copy of the plugin located here: http://wordpress.org/plugins/root-relative-urls/

It contains variouse hacks and fixes to work around some of the issues reported on the support forum there.

I keep this copy becuase it appears the original author is no longer maintaining the plugin and I cannot build certain typese of sites without it. 

The fixes I make here are mostly to allow me to continue using it. If you have some special need I may look at it. Or you can fork this and make your own mods.
